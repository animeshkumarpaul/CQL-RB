# CQL-RB: Conservative Q-Learning with Representation Balancing (CQL-RB)

This repository contains the implementation and experiment scripts for **CQL-RB**, a method for offline policy learning from **simulated healthcare trajectories** generated using open-source simulators (e.g., **EpiCare**, **AhnChemo**).  
**No identifiable human-subject data are used** in this project.
